# Strategy-Plan-for-DNA-Data-Storage
This project explored the technical feasibility, potential applications, and market readiness of DNA Data Storage technology, emphasizing its integration into the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) sector. In our 2210: Technology Strategy, under the supervision of Prof. Yiorgos Kostuolas, my team and I conducted a SWOT analysis, proposed innovative service ideas tailored for the sector accordingly, and assessed trade-offs to optimize benefits. By analyzing the current types of storage systems and their limitations, the project aimed to provide a clear roadmap for leveraging DNA Data Storage as a secure, high-capacity, and sustainable alternative. The final report and presentation earned top marks.
